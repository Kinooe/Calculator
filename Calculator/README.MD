    Gotchas: watch out for and fix these bugs if they show up in your code:
        
        You should round answers with long decimals so that they don’t overflow the screen.
        Pressing = before entering all of the numbers or an operator could cause problems!
        BUG:a,op,b auto does it
        Display a snarky error message if the user tries to divide by 0… don’t let it crash your calculator!
    EXTRA CREDIT: Users can get floating point numbers if they do the math required to get one, but they can’t type them in yet. Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you don’t let them type more than one though: 12.3.56.5. It is hard to do math on these numbers. (disable the decimal button if there’s already one in the display)
    EXTRA CREDIT: Make it look nice! This can be a good portfolio project… but not if it’s UGLY. At least make the operations a different color from the keypad buttons.
    EXTRA CREDIT: Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.
    EXTRA CREDIT: Add keyboard support!
